# Assistance Needed: Package Installation Failure

## Task
Task 8: Install New Tooling - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and verify `cct --help` works.

## Error Details
The installation fails because the package `tree-sitter-languages` cannot be found:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tree-sitter-languages (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tree-sitter-languages
```

## Attempted Solutions
1. Created a virtual environment to isolate the installation.
2. Tried installing all requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Attempted to install only the local package with `pip install -e .`.

## Current Requirements.txt Content
```
-e .
qdrant-client
sentence-transformers
tree-sitter
tree-sitter-languages
```

## Request
Please advise on how to proceed - whether to find an alternative package, modify requirements.txt, or adjust the installation method.
