## Problem: Unable to switch to vector-updater mode

The Orchestrator AI was unable to switch to the `vector-updater` mode as specified in the rules. This prevents the system from updating the vector database with the modified files.

## Details:
- The `MODIFIED_FILES.txt` signal file exists, indicating a need for vector database updates.
- Attempting to switch to `vector-updater` mode results in an "Invalid mode" error.

## Recommendation:
Investigate why the `vector-updater` mode is not available and implement a solution to update the vector database.
