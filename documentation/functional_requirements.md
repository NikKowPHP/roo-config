# Functional Requirements: Vector Database Agent Tool

## 1. Code Indexing
### 1.1 Source Code Processing
- The system shall accept directories of source code files for indexing
- The system shall split source code into logical chunks (functions, classes, blocks)
- The system shall generate vector embeddings for each code chunk using Sentence Transformers
- The system shall store embeddings in Qdrant vector database with metadata (file path, line numbers)

### 1.2 Supported Languages
- The system shall support Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and C# by default
- The system shall allow adding new language parsers via plugins

## 2. Natural Language Query Interface
### 2.1 Query Processing
- The system shall accept natural language queries about code functionality
- The system shall convert queries to vector embeddings using the same model as code indexing
- The system shall return top 5 most relevant code segments with surrounding context

### 2.2 Result Presentation
- Results shall include file path, line numbers, and code snippet
- Results shall include similarity score indicating match confidence
- Users shall be able to request additional context for any result

## 3. File-based Update System
### 3.1 Incremental Indexing
- The system shall monitor specified directories for file changes
- The system shall re-index only modified files
- The system shall maintain version history of indexed files

### 3.2 Change Tracking
- The system shall detect and index new files added to monitored directories
- The system shall remove embeddings for deleted files
- The system shall provide change reports after each update

## 4. Configuration-driven Operation
### 4.1 Configuration File
- The system shall use INI-style configuration files
- The system shall support configuration of:
  - Database connection parameters
  - Embedding model selection
  - Chunking parameters (max size, overlap)
  - Watched directories

### 4.2 Runtime Options
- The system shall support command-line overrides for configuration parameters
- The system shall provide verbose logging options
- The system shall support dry-run mode for testing configurations
