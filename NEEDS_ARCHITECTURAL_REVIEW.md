## Original Problem:
The system encountered a missing `NEEDS_ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md` file during strategic intervention mode, indicating a state management failure.

## Failed Fix Attempt:
Previous attempts to handle signal files may have prematurely deleted critical state files during cleanup operations.

## New Error:
The architectural review file was not found when attempting to read it, preventing proper diagnosis of the underlying issue.
