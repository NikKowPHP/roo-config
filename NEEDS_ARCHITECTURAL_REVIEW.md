## Original Problem:
1 | ## Problem: Unable to switch to vector-updater mode
2 | 
3 | The Orchestrator AI was unable to switch to the `vector-updater` mode as specified in the rules. This prevents the system from updating the vector database with the modified files.
4 | 
5 | ## Details:
6 | - The `MODIFIED_FILES.txt` signal file exists, indicating a need for vector database updates.
7 | - Attempting to switch to `vector-updater` mode results in an "Invalid mode" error.
8 | 
9 | ## Recommendation:
10 | Investigate why the `vector-updater` mode is not available and implement a solution to update the vector database.

## Failed Fix Attempt:
# Fix Plan: Enable Vector Updater Mode
 
## Diagnosis
The Orchestrator AI is unable to switch to the `vector-updater` mode, even though it is defined in `custom_modes.yaml`. This indicates a problem with loading or recognizing custom modes.
 
## Task 1: Verify Custom Modes Configuration [x]
 
- **LLM Prompt:** "Read the contents of `.roo/custom_modes.yaml` and verify that the `vector-updater` mode is correctly defined, including its slug, name, roleDefinition, and groups."
- **Verification:** Manually review the file content to confirm the `vector-updater` mode is correctly defined.
 
## Task 2: Reload Custom Modes Configuration
- **LLM Prompt:** "Execute the `copy_script.sh` script to reload the custom modes configuration."
- **Verification:** Check the output of the script to confirm it executed successfully.
 
## Task 3: Attempt Mode Switch Again
- **LLM Prompt:** "Switch to `vector-updater` mode with the contents of `MODIFIED_FILES.txt` as the reason."
- **Verification:** Confirm that the mode switch is successful.
 
## Task 4: Clean up and reset for autonomous handoff
- **LLM Prompt:** "Delete the file `NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md` from the root directory."
- **Verification:** The file `NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md` no longer exists.
