# Fix Plan: Enable Vector Updater Mode

## Diagnosis
The Orchestrator AI is unable to switch to the `vector-updater` mode, even though it is defined in `custom_modes.yaml`. This indicates a problem with loading or recognizing custom modes.

## Task 1: Verify Custom Modes Configuration [x]
- **LLM Prompt:** "Read the contents of `.roo/custom_modes.yaml` and verify that the `vector-updater` mode is correctly defined, including its slug, name, roleDefinition, and groups."
- **Verification:** Manually review the file content to confirm the `vector-updater` mode is correctly defined.

## Task 2: Reload Custom Modes Configuration
- **LLM Prompt:** "Execute the `copy_script.sh` script to reload the custom modes configuration."
- **Verification:** Check the output of the script to confirm it executed successfully.

## Task 3: Attempt Mode Switch Again
- **LLM Prompt:** "Switch to `vector-updater` mode with the contents of `MODIFIED_FILES.txt` as the reason."
- **Verification:** Confirm that the mode switch is successful.

## Task 4: Clean up and reset for autonomous handoff
- **LLM Prompt:** "Delete the file `NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md` from the root directory."
- **Verification:** The file `NEEDS_ASSISTANCE.md` no longer exists.
